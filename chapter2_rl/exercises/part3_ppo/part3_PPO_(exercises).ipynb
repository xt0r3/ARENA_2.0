When calling `next_obs = envs.reset()`, next_obs gets a batch of $N$ initial observations (pronounced \"next observation\"). PPO also initializes an environment `done` flag variable next_done (pronounced \"next done\") to an $N$-length array of zeros, where its i-th element `next_done[i]` has values of 0 or 1 which corresponds to the $i$-th sub-environment being *not done* and *done*, respectively.\n",
