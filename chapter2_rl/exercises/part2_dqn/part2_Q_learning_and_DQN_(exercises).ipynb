Agents that cheat and peek at `info` are helpful because we know that they should obtain the maximum possible rewards; if they aren't, then there's a bug.

If a state-action pair $(s,a)$ with low Q-value $Q^*(s,a)$ just so happens to return a high reward by chance, the greedy policy with respect to $Q$ will often choose action $a$ in state $s$ instead of exploring potentially other good actions first. To remedy this, we use instead an $\\epsilon$-greedy policy with respect to the current Q-value estimates: With probability $\\epsilon$, a random action is chosen, and with probability $1-\\epsilon$ the greedy action $\\text{argmax}_a Q(s,a)$ is chosen. The exploration probability $\\epsilon$ is a hyperparameter that for now we will set to a constant $\\epsilon = 0.1$, but more sophisticated techniques include the use of a schedule to start exploring often early, and then decay exploration as times goes on.\n",

The main difference is that, instead of a table to store all the Q-values for each state-action pair, we train a neural network to learn this function for us. The usual implementation (which we'll use here) is for the Q-network to take the state as input, and output a vector of Q-values for each action, i.e. we're learning the function $s \\to (Q(s, a_1), ..., Q(s, a_n))$.\n",

        "The goal of DQN is to reduce the reinforcement learning problem to a supervised learning problem.\n",
        "In supervised learning, training examples should be drawn **i.i.d**. from some distribution, and we hope to generalize to future examples from that distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "In RL, the distribution of experiences $e_t = (s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1})$ to train from depend on the policy $\\pi$ followed, which depends on the current state of the Q-value network, so DQN is always chasing a moving target. This is why the training loss curve isn't going to have a nice steady decrease like in supervised learning. We will extend experiences to $e_t = (o_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, o_{t+1}, d_{t+1})$. Here, $d_{t+1}$ is a boolean indicating that $o_{t+1}$ is a terminal observation, and that no further interaction happened beyond $s_{t+1}$ in the episode from which it was generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Correlated States\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to DQN using a neural network to learn the Q-values, the value of many state-action pairs are aggregated together (unlike tabular Q-learning which learns independently the value of each state-action pair). For example, consider a game of chess. The board will have some encoding as a vector, but visually similar board states might have wildly different consequences for the best move. Another problem is that states within an episode are highly correlated and not i.i.d. at all. A few bad moves from the start of the game might doom the rest of the game regardless how well the agent tries to recover, whereas a few bad moves near the end of the game might not matter if the agent has a very strong lead, or is so far behind the game is already lost. Training mostly on an episode where the agent opened the game poorly might disincentive good moves to recover, as these too will have poor Q-value estimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Uniform Sampling\n",
        "\n",
        "To recover from this problem and make the environment look \"more i.i.d\", a simple strategy that works decently well is to pick a buffer size, store experiences and uniformly sample out of that buffer. Intuitively, if we want the policy to play well in all sorts of states, the sampled batch should be a representative sample of all the diverse scenarios that can happen in the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "For complex environments, this implies a very large batch size (or doing something better than uniform sampling). [OpenAI Five](https://cdn.openai.com/dota-2.pdf) used batch sizes of over 2 million experiences for Dota 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "The capacity of the replay buffer is yet another hyperparameter; if it's too small then it's just going to be full of recent and correlated examples. But if it's too large, we pay an increasing cost in memory usage and the information may be too old to be relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implement `ReplayBuffer`. It only needs to handle a discrete action space, and you can assume observations are some shape of dtype `np.float32`, and actions are of dtype `np.int64`. The replay buffer will store experiences $e_t = (o_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, o_{t+1}, d_{t+1})$ in a circular queue. If the buffer is already full, the oldest experience is overwritten.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should also include objects `self.observations`, `self.actions`, etc in your `ReplayBuffer` class. This is just so that you can plot them against your shuffled replay buffer, and verify that the outputs look reasonable (see the next section).\n"
